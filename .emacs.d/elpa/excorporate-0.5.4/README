Excorporate provides Exchange integration for Emacs.

To create a connection to a web service:

M-x excorporate

Excorporate will prompt for an email address that it will use to
automatically discover settings.  Then it will connect to two
separate hosts: the autodiscovery host and the web service host, so
you may be prompted for your credentials twice.

You should see a message indicating that the connection is ready
either in the minibuffer or failing that in the *Messages* buffer.

Finally, run M-x calendar, and press 'e' to show today's meetings.
